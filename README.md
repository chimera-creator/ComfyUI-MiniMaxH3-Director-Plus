# ComfyUI MiniMax H3 Director Plus

**A timeline editor for [MiniMax H3](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3) inside ComfyUI.**
Drag images, videos and music onto tracks, trim them on a ruler, write a prompt per shot,
press Run. Instead of one prompt box for a whole clip you get a storyboard — and you can
see the exact prompt the model will receive while you are still editing it.

## News

**0.1.5** · 2026-08-06 — picture notes in `Refs ON` now use the reference guide's own
phrasing for frame anchors: `[Shot 1] begins from <Picture 1>`, `ends on`, and
`The keyframe of [Shot 2] corresponds to …`.

**0.1.4** · 2026-08-06 — `overall_soundscape` and `non_diegetic_music` have their own boxes
under the Global Prompt, and the alignment line's end mark can no longer name a moment past
the end of the video.

**0.1.3** · 2026-08-06 — new **MiniMax H3 Enhance Prompt** node: a local vision model turns
reference images plus a one-line idea into a prompt for the Director, and hands the same
images on so it describes exactly what H3 will condition on.

**0.1.2** · 2026-08-06 — reference images are numbered along the timeline again, and prompts
in `Refs OFF` now carry the image-alignment instruction MiniMax's guide requires. The
Director Chain node is withdrawn until it can actually be operated.

**0.1.1** · 2026-08-04 — only the checkpoint the toolbar asks for is loaded, instead of both
model inputs reading ~42 GB of weights to use half of them.

**0.1.0** · 2026-08-04 — first public release: the LTX Director timeline editor by
WhatDreamsCost, ported to MiniMax H3.

Full history in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Why

MiniMax H3 generates video **and** audio jointly, takes reference images, videos and audio,
and anchors on a first and last frame. All of that is reachable through core ComfyUI
nodes — but you address it by hand-writing a storyboard prompt, counting frames onto a
17k+5 grid, and wiring conditioning nodes for every reference.

This node turns that into an editor. Segments on a track become shots with timestamps.
Images dropped on the track become keyframes or `<Picture i>` references. Audio becomes
either a reference or the muxed soundtrack. The prompt is compiled for you, live, and you
can read it before you spend a render on it.

## What you get

Six nodes, category **MiniMax H3**:

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| **MiniMax H3 Director Plus** | The timeline. Outputs a patched `model`, the compiled `positive` conditioning, an empty joint AV `latent`, the muxed `combined_audio`, plus `fps` / `width` / `height` / `length` / `prompt` / `retake_info`. |
| **MiniMax H3 Casting Director Plus** | A reusable nine-slot character editor. Connect its `CAST` output to the Director's `cast` input; without that connection, the Director's built-in character slots continue to work. Its `ANALYZE SETTINGS` output can connect to Wardrobe Director for item analysis. |
| **MiniMax H3 Wardrobe Director Plus** | Assign up to eighteen clothing/accessory reference images and descriptions to the active cast. It creates one wardrobe collage per character. Connect `CAST + WARDROBE` and optionally `ANALYZE SETTINGS` from Casting Director, then connect its output to the Director's `cast` input. |
| **MiniMax H3 Preview Override Plus** | Watch the whole shot denoise, not a single frozen frame. |
| **MiniMax H3 Retake Stitch Plus** | Splices a regenerated range back into the base video. |
| **MiniMax H3 Enhance Prompt Plus** | A local vision model writes the prompt from your reference images. |

Editing features carried over from LTX Director: main track, reference-video track, audio
track, ruler in seconds or frames, drag / resize / copy / paste, prompt zones per segment,
waveform preview, filename labels, gear menu, workspace folder, chunked upload for large
videos, drag-and-drop straight onto the node, and the `@char1` … `@char9`
character slots including the optional local VLM "Analyze" button (Ollama / LM Studio /
any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) with automatic VRAM release before a run.

## Requirements

* **ComfyUI ≥ 0.30.0** — H3 support, `comfy_api.latest` and the packed AV latent all
  landed in 0.30. Older builds will fail to load the nodes.
* **Python 3.10+** (ComfyUI's own environment; the portable build's `python_embeded` is fine).
* **No extra pip packages.** Everything the nodes import ships with ComfyUI already.
* **VRAM:** the fp8 checkpoints are ~21 GB on disk. 16 GB VRAM works with ComfyUI's
  offloading at 480p–768p; below that expect heavy swapping. The text encoder is a
  separate ~15 GB load.
* **Disk:** budget ~60 GB if you want both model paths plus the text encoder and VAEs.

## Installation

### Via ComfyUI Manager (recommended)

1. Open **Manager → Custom Nodes Manager**
2. Search for **MiniMax H3 Director Plus**
3. **Install**, then restart ComfyUI and reload the browser tab.

Not listed yet? Use **Manager → Install via Git URL** and paste:

```
https://github.com/seesee75-commits/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Director
```

### Manual

Clone into your `custom_nodes` folder and restart:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/seesee75-commits/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Director ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Director-Plus
```

On the Windows portable build the folder is
`ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI\custom_nodes`.

There is **nothing to pip install** — the package declares no third-party dependencies.

Then restart ComfyUI **and hard-reload the browser** (Ctrl+F5). The timeline is a
frontend extension; a stale cached `.js` is the single most common "node looks broken"
report.

### Updating

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Director-Plus
git pull
```

## Models

Download from [🤗 Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3).
The example workflow carries download links, so ComfyUI can offer to fetch them for you.

**Put the files directly in these folders — no subfolder.** A file at
`models/diffusion_models/MiniMax-H3/…` will not match the example workflow.

```
ComfyUI/models/
├── diffusion_models/
│   ├── minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_fp8_scaled.safetensors     21 GB   ← text/keyframe path
│   └── minimax_h3_ref2va_pruned_fp8_scaled.safetensors    21 GB   ← reference path
├── text_encoders/
│   └── qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3_nvfp4_awq.safetensors       15 GB
└── vae/
    ├── minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors             4.9 GB
    └── minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32.safetensors             0.6 GB
```

**The two diffusion checkpoints are not interchangeable — they are separate trainings:**

| Toolbar switch | Checkpoint | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| **Refs OFF** | `minimax_h3_fl2va_*` | text→video, and first/last keyframes from the timeline |
| **Refs ON** | `minimax_h3_ref2va_*` | character slots, reference images, reference videos, reference audio |

Connect both to the Director's two model inputs and the toolbar switch picks the right
one. Connecting only one is fine — the node warns rather than silently using the wrong path.

Only the selected checkpoint is ever read from disk: the model inputs are lazy, so with
the toolbar on **Refs OFF** the `ref2va` loader never runs at all. Wiring both costs you
disk space, not RAM.

Other quantisations on the repo work too: `*_bf16` (66 GB, best quality),
`*_int8_convrot` (34 GB), `*_pruned_int8_convrot` (21 GB). The text encoder also comes as
`_bf16` and `_int8_convrot` if `nvfp4_awq` does not run on your GPU.

## Quick start

1. **Workflow → Open** → `example_workflows/MiniMax H3 Director.json`
   (or drag [`docs/images/workflow-overview.png`](docs/images/workflow-overview.png)
   onto the canvas — the same graph is embedded in that screenshot)
2. Fix any red nodes — usually the model dropdowns, if your filenames differ.
3. Double-click a segment on the main track and type what should happen.
4. Drag an image onto the track for a first-frame anchor (optional).
5. **Run.**

Read the **COMPILED PROMPT** panel under the timeline before running: it shows the exact
text the model will get, the shot count, the frame count and the reference tally, plus
warnings for the things that silently bite.

Defaults that matter, if you wire it yourself:

* `CLIPLoader` **type must be `minimax`**.
* Sampler `res_multistep`, scheduler `simple`, ~20 steps, through `BasicGuider` (no CFG).
  For reference-heavy `ref2va` prompts, `beta` or `normal` often beats `simple`.
* The joint latent goes to **both** `VAEDecode` (video VAE) **and** `VAEDecodeAudio`
  (audio VAE); each pulls its own half out. `CreateVideo` muxes them.
* Length snaps up to H3's 17k+5 frame grid at 24 fps — 5 s becomes 124 frames (5.17 s).
* Native canvas is a 768 px short edge, capped at 768×1344.

The example packs the sampler and the two decoders into subgraphs so the graph stays
readable; open them if you want to change sampler, scheduler or steps.

## The timeline

| Track | Drop this | Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Main** | images | first/last keyframe (Refs OFF) or `<Picture i>` (Refs ON) |
| **Main** | prompt zones | `[Shot N]` entries with timestamps |
| **Reference video** | video clips | `<Video k>` motion/style references |
| **Audio** | music, SFX | `<Audio j>` reference and/or the muxed soundtrack |

### Reference limits

From MiniMax's own model card — not from ComfyUI's node signatures, which are looser.
These are enforced, with a warning naming exactly what was dropped:

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Reference images | ≤ 9 — the nine character slots *and* the `ref_images` input share this pool |
| Reference videos | ≤ 3 clips, each 2–15 s, **≤ 15 s total** |
| Reference audio | ≤ 3 clips |
| **All types together** | **≤ 12 files** |

Output envelope: 4–15 s at 24 fps. Aspect ratios 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:4, 9:16.

Anything you drop on a track is uploaded to `ComfyUI/input/whatdreamscost/`. That is the
same folder LTX Director uses, deliberately — if you run both, assets and saved timelines
carry over between them.

### Character slots and the Analyze button

Drop a face or a full-body shot into `@char1` … `@char9` and write `@char1` in a prompt;
it expands to `<Subject 1>` (MiniMax notation) or `<Picture 1>` (ComfyUI notation) and the
image is attached as a reference. This is the **Refs ON (ref2va)** path.

**Analyze** is optional and off the critical path. It sends the slot image to a local
vision model and asks for JSON containing separate `appearance` and `wardrobe` fields.
Appearance covers physical traits without clothing; Wardrobe covers clothing and
accessories. The two fields are merged into the Director's one-line character description,
so `@char1` still means something in **Refs OFF** mode, where H3 gets no image at all.
Nothing is installed for you and nothing is sent anywhere unless you press the button.

To use it, run a vision model locally and point the gear menu's provider row at it:

| Provider | Default URL | Set up |
|---|---|---|
| Ollama | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` | `ollama pull qwen2.5vl:7b` — any vision model works, the field is free text |
| LM Studio | `http://127.0.0.1:1234` | load a vision model, start the local server |
| Custom | — | any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint |

With Ollama the node also asks it to unload the model before a render, so the VLM does not
sit in VRAM while H3 samples.

If you want the same cast shared by several Director nodes, use **MiniMax H3 Casting
Director Plus**. It has the same nine `@char1` … `@char9` slots, up to nine character
images total, image upload, Appearance and Wardrobe inputs, and Analyze controls. Connect its `CAST`
output to each Director's `cast` input, or connect `CAST + WARDROBE` to the Wardrobe Director.
Use each slot's **HIRE** toggle to choose
which characters pass through. Hired characters are compacted in order, so Casting slot 2
becomes Director slot 1 when slot 1 is not hired. Use **REMOVE** to clear a cast member.
An external cast replaces only the Director's character slots; the Director's timeline,
prompt overrides and sound fields remain independent.

Each cast member also has a **Pronouns** setting (**Auto**, **He / Him**, **She / Her**, or
**They / Them**). Wardrobe items categorized as **Anatomy** follow the clothing items in
the wardrobe prompt and use that cast member's possessive pronoun, such as `her body has a`
or `his body has a`.

The **MiniMax H3 Wardrobe Director Plus** has eighteen item slots. Drop one clothing or
accessory reference image into an item, enter its item description, and assign it to one
or more active characters. It creates one collage per character containing every assigned
item, then sends those collages and their final item descriptions in a separate
`wardrobe_definitions` prompt section directly below `subject_definitions`.
Connect the Casting Director's `ANALYZE SETTINGS` output to enable an **ANALYZE** button
on each item; the same provider, model, URL, and optional API key are used for the item
description analysis.

Wardrobe items also have a category dropdown: **Full Outfits**, **Tops**, **Bottoms**,
**Accessories**, or **Anatomy**. Use Anatomy for close-up references of distinctive body
parts. Both the Wardrobe Director and the main Director can save to a named project. Project
data is merged into `Projects/<project>/wardrobe/project.json`, with referenced input assets
copied into `Projects/<project>/wardrobe/resources/`. A Director save includes the compiled
prompt, timeline, render metadata, cast/wardrobe connections, and connected enhanced-prompt
settings; later saves from the connected nodes update their source sections in the same file.

**Keyframes go on the first and last frame only.** H3's `PackedLayout` anchors exactly
those two positions; an image stranded in the middle of a window is reported in the
warnings rather than silently ignored.

## Prompt format

Gear menu → **Prompt Format**. The default is **MiniMax**, the notation from their own
`VIDEO_PROMPT_WRITING_GUIDE`:

```
subject_definitions: <Subject 1> is the character shown in <Picture 1>.

retention_analysis: Keep the identity, face and clothing of <Subject 1> consistent across every shot.

detailed_description: Live-action, cinematic. [Shot 1] the baker opens the shutters
[Shot 2] At 00:01.500, <Subject 1> lifts the loaf onto the counter

overall_soundscape: street ambience, a distant tram
non_diegetic_music: soft piano
```

The first shot carries no timestamp; every later cut carries a strictly increasing
`MM:SS.mmm` one. Sections appear only when there is something real to put in them.

The two sound sections have their own boxes under the Global Prompt. What you type there
goes straight into `overall_soundscape` and `non_diegetic_music`. Leave them empty and the
sections are omitted entirely — an empty heading is worse than none.

`Audio:` / `Sound:` / `SFX:` and `Music:` / `Score:` lines written in the prompt text are
still lifted into the same two sections, so older workflows and the Enhance node keep
working. A filled box wins over a lifted line.

**`<Subject N>` vs `<Picture N>`** is worth knowing: the guide reserves `<Subject N>` for
reusable content — a person, a place, a style — and `<Picture N>` for concrete frame
anchors. ComfyUI's tokenizer only ever labels images `<Picture i>`, so
`subject_definitions` binds the two. That is what lets a character keep one name across
every cut. `@char1` therefore expands to `<Subject 1>` here.

**ComfyUI** switches to `[0s-1.5s] …`, the notation the ComfyUI H3 templates use. Same
timeline, same references, only the wording changes — so it is a fair A/B.

### Why a storyboard and not a per-segment mask

If you know LTX Director: its Prompt Relay builds a cross-attention mask so each segment
gets its own prompt. That cannot port. H3's DiT runs full self-attention over one packed
`[text | cond | audio | video]` sequence with `mask=None` hardcoded, so a relay mask would
have to span the entire sequence — several GB per attention call at 1344×768. The
storyboard is not a workaround: H3's Qwen3-VL encoder was trained on exactly this notation.

## Live preview while sampling

ComfyUI ships `latent_rgb_factors` for H3, so previews work — but `Latent2RGBPreviewer`
renders `x0[0, :, 0]`, the **first latent frame only**. You watch a still image while a
five-second shot is being sampled. KJNodes' Preview Override does the good version of
this, but its video paths are gated on LTX checks and nothing there unpacks H3's packed AV
latent, so on MiniMax it falls through to the same single frame.

**MiniMax H3 Preview Override Plus** goes between the Director's `model` output and the sampler
and renders the whole shot as it denoises.

<img src="docs/images/preview-override-node.png" alt="The Preview Override node" width="360">


| Widget | What it does |
|---|---|
| `decode` | `latent2rgb (fast)` — one matmul, ~10 ms, rough colours. `vae (quality)` — the real decoder, true colours, real cost. |
| `preview_target` | `node` shows it on this node — always available. `sampler (VHS)` puts it in the sampler's usual preview slot and needs [VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite) installed; `both` does both. |
| `preview_frames` | Cap on **latent** frames used, thinned evenly across the shot, so it shortens nothing. The main cost knob. |
| `preview_fps` | The shot's frame rate. A FLOAT, so the Director's `fps` output wires straight in. |
| `max_resolution` | Long edge of the preview image, as a **target** — latent2rgb frames arrive at latent size (a 1344×768 shot is an 84×48 grid), so this upscales them smoothly. |
| `webp_quality` | Quality of the animation sent to the browser. |
| `every_n_steps` | Never preview more often than every N sampler steps. |
| `max_preview_overhead` | Share of render time previews may use, in percent (default 25). After a preview costing C seconds the next waits `C·(100/P − 1)` s. 0 disables. |
| `suppress_default_preview` | Hides ComfyUI's built-in single-frame preview. |

The time in the status line (`render 9.9s`) is **server-side**: how long ComfyUI took to
decode, scale and encode that preview. Not browser time, not the sampler. With
`latent2rgb` it is tens of milliseconds; with `vae (quality)` at 1344×768 it can be 20–25 s,
because the real decoder expands 37 latent frames into 124 output frames through a 5 GB
VAE. Capping the frame *rate* would not help — rate only sets playback speed. The cost
knobs are `preview_frames` (try 4–8 for VAE), `max_resolution` and `every_n_steps`.

`vae (quality)` is the answer to "is there a small preview VAE, like LTX 2.3?" — there is
not. MiniMax has not released a TAESD-style decoder (`latent_format.taesd_decoder_name` is
`None`), so the choice is the cheap RGB approximation or the real video VAE.

<details>
<summary>Two non-obvious details, both of which produced real bugs here</summary>

**The latent is not the video.** `CFGGuider.sample` packs video and audio into one flat
tensor and only *then* wraps the callback with the nested view — and that wrapper sits
behind any `OUTER_SAMPLE` wrapper. What reaches a preview is the flat pack, which has to
be unpacked with core's `unpack_latents` first.

**Latent frames are not output frames.** H3 compresses time ~3.35× (17k+5 output frames
become 5k+2 latent frames), so a 124-frame shot is 37 latent frames. Playing those at 24
fps runs the preview three times too fast. The playback rate is derived from the *output*
duration — `shown_frames × fps ÷ output_frames` — so the preview lasts exactly as long as
the finished shot, thinning included.

</details>

## Writing the prompt for you

**MiniMax H3 Enhance Prompt Plus** hands your reference images and a one-line idea to a local
vision model and gets back prompt text shaped for H3. The same images come out of its
`ref_images` output, so what the model described is exactly what H3 conditions on.

<img src="docs/images/enhance-prompt-node.png" alt="The Enhance Prompt node" width="380">

Ready-made graph: `example_workflows/MiniMax H3 Director + Enhance Prompt.json`.

```
LoadImage ─→ image0 ┐
LoadImage ─→ image1 ├→ Enhance Prompt ─┬→ prompt           → Director.global_prompt
                    ┘                  ├→ ref_images       → Director.ref_images
                                       └→ duration_seconds → Director.duration
```

Sockets grow as you connect, up to nine, and close the gap again when you disconnect.

| Widget | What it does |
|---|---|
| `idea` | What you want, in plain words. |
| `preset` | `global` writes scene, style, subjects and lighting and leaves the shots to your timeline. `storyboard` writes the whole shot sequence with timestamps — only for timelines whose segments carry no prompt text, or the two shot numberings collide. |
| `system_prompt` | Overrides the built-in instructions, which follow MiniMax's own prompt-writing guide. |
| `provider` / `base_url` / `model` / `api_key` | Ollama, LM Studio, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. `api_key` is optional and is sent as a Bearer token only when set. `http://` is added if you leave the base URL off; host and port only, no path. |
| `use_spicy_model` | Runs the first-pass prompt through a second model with a sensual/mature detail pass. Off by default. |
| `spicy_model` | Second-pass model name. Empty reuses the primary model. |
| `spicy_system_prompt` | Optional replacement for the built-in spicy second-pass instructions. |
| `seed` | ComfyUI caches node outputs, so an unchanged input never re-asks the model. Change this to force a fresh answer. |
| `max_words` | Caps the description. MiniMax's guide puts it at 350–500 words. |
| `unload_after` | Frees the vision model's VRAM when done. Leave it on unless you are iterating. |
| `on_error` | `passthrough` hands your raw text on and warns, so a stopped Ollama does not kill a render. |

**It has to be a vision model.** A text-only model ignores your images without saying so.
`qwen2.5vl:7b` is a reasonable Ollama default; anything larger writes noticeably better
prompts. Expect 15–45 s per run, during which the queue is blocked.

**What it deliberately does not write:** section labels, `<Picture N>` numbering, or shot
markers in `global` mode. The Director compiles the structured MiniMax prompt and assigns
the reference numbers — a second set from the model would nest structure inside structure
and collide with the Director's own ordinals. The instructions forbid it and the output is
filtered anyway, because small models do not reliably obey.

**If the VLM and H3 share a GPU**, the vision model is evicted after each run
(`unload_after`). Ollama has no per-request device selection, so to put it on a different
card you set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` on the Ollama *service*, not here.

## Retake Mode

Load a base video, turn on **Retake Mode** in the toolbar, mark a range: the Director
regenerates only that range, anchored on the base video's own frames either side of it.
The frame before the range becomes `first_frame`, the frame after becomes `last_frame` —
exactly what H3's first/last anchors are for, so the new material meets the old on both cuts.

Wire the Director's `retake_info` output into **MiniMax H3 Retake Stitch Plus** together with
the decoded images (and audio) to get the full video back: base head + retake + base tail,
video and audio, resampled to 24 fps. `keep_base_audio` keeps the original soundtrack
across the whole thing instead of the generated one.

## Longer than 15 seconds

Not solved yet. There was a **Director Chain** node that rendered a long timeline as a
chain of anchored windows, and its sampling worked — but there was no usable way to hand
it a timeline, so it has been withdrawn rather than shipped as a feature nobody can
operate. The code stays in the repository; the reasoning is written down at the top of
`minimax_chain.py`.

Until it returns, H3's trained range is the limit: 4-15 s per render.

## Troubleshooting

**The nodes do not appear after installing.**
Restart ComfyUI fully and hard-reload the browser (Ctrl+F5). If they still do not appear,
look at the ComfyUI console during startup — an import error is printed there. Check your
ComfyUI version is ≥ 0.30.0.

**The node loads but the timeline is blank / looks like a plain widget list.**
Stale frontend cache. Ctrl+F5. In a private window it will look correct if that is the cause.

**`ERROR: clip input is invalid` / garbage output.**
`CLIPLoader` type must be set to **minimax**, not `stable_diffusion` or anything else.

**`vae.decode()` fails, or the video is noise but the audio is fine.**
The joint latent must go to `VAEDecode` with the **video** VAE and `VAEDecodeAudio` with
the **audio** VAE. Swapping the two VAEs is the usual cause.

**The finished video is a flat, featureless grey, but the audio is fine and the live
preview looked right.**
The latent is good and the video VAE is producing NaN. Flat grey — not noise, not black,
every pixel the same value — is what NaN looks like after clamping. `latent2rgb` previews
keep working because they never touch the VAE.

Confirm it in a minute instead of a full render: set the Preview Override's `decode` to
`vae (quality)`. That runs the same video VAE, so if the preview goes grey too, the VAE
is where it breaks.

The thing to try is precision. `minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16` runs in fp16, and ComfyUI's own
help text for `--fp16-vae` says it "might cause black images". Start ComfyUI with
**`--fp32-vae`**. fp32 is the *only* alternative here: ComfyUI declares this VAE's working
dtypes as `[float16, float32]`, so `--bf16-vae` silently gets you one of those two. The
decoder grows from ~4.9 GB to ~10 GB, which on a 16 GB card means partial offload and a
slower decode; `--cpu-vae` is the slow-but-certain fallback.

Reported once so far, on ROCm/Windows, where fp16 convolution kernels take different code
paths than on CUDA. Not reproduced on CUDA, and the fp32 remedy is not yet confirmed by
the reporter — if you hit this, please say whether it helped.

**Out of memory.**
Lower the resolution first (768 short edge is native, but 480 works), then `length`. With
`vae (quality)` previews, lower `preview_frames` to 4 — a VAE preview allocates as much as
a real decode. Consider the `_pruned_fp8_scaled` checkpoints if you are on `_bf16`.

**"neither model input is connected".**
The Director has two model inputs on purpose: `model (t2v/i2v)` for `fl2va` and
`model (ref2v)` for `ref2va`. Connect at least the one your toolbar switch selects.

**Images in the middle of the timeline seem ignored (Refs OFF).**
They are — H3 anchors first and last frame only. Switch to **Refs ON** and they become
`<Picture i>` references instead, or move them to the window edges.

**The generated clip is longer than I asked for.**
Length snaps up to the 17k+5 grid: 5, 22, 39, 56, 73, 90, 107, 124 … frames. 5 s → 124
frames → 5.17 s. This is the model's grid, not a bug.

## Reporting a bug

Open an [issue](https://github.com/seesee75-commits/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Director/issues). The three
things that make a report fixable:

1. the **full traceback** from the ComfyUI console (not just the last line),
2. the **workflow JSON** (Workflow → Export), and
3. which **model files** you loaded.

The issue form asks for exactly these. For anything about dragging, resizing or the
preview window, add the **browser** console (F12 → Console) too.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, and so are reports from hardware this has never run on — every
line of it was verified on a single NVIDIA card, so ROCm and Apple silicon are unknown
territory. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the layout, the three checks to run
before submitting, and the handful of rules that exist because breaking them caused a real
bug.
